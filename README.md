# s.ai

**s.ai** is a ready-to-start AI SaaS starter package focused on fast product delivery, free-model experimentation, and multi-provider flexibility.

It is designed for developers and teams who want to launch AI applications quickly without rebuilding the same authentication, database, and AI-integration foundation every time.

## Vision

s.ai helps you move from idea to working AI app with minimal setup.

The project is built around three practical goals:

1. **Quick Start**: begin building product features immediately.
2. **Provider Freedom**: switch across AI providers without rewriting your app logic.
3. **Cost-Friendly Development**: support free and low-cost models for early-stage building and testing.

## What s.ai Provides

### 1) AI SaaS Foundation

- Centralized AI provider configuration
- Unified model selection flow
- Support for multiple providers and model catalogs
- Compatibility with both raw and higher-level AI integration patterns

### 2) Product-Ready App Base

- Authentication-ready architecture
- Database-ready architecture
- Modular project structure for scaling features
- API route foundation for backend AI workflows

### 3) Developer Experience

- Strong TypeScript-first organization
- Clean module boundaries (`ai`, `auth`, `db`, `services`)
- Easy branch/PR workflow for team collaboration
- Built to evolve from prototype to production

## Who This Is For

s.ai is a good fit if you are:

- building your first AI SaaS product,
- validating startup ideas quickly,
- testing free models before scaling to paid inference,
- creating internal AI tools with fast iteration cycles.

## Core Product Philosophy

Instead of treating AI as a single-provider lock-in, s.ai treats AI as a **pluggable infrastructure layer**.

That means your application logic can stay stable while providers, models, and pricing strategies evolve over time.

## Current Project Direction

The current implementation focuses on:

- establishing a reusable AI provider system,
- setting up auth and database building blocks,
- providing a clean app shell for future SaaS features.

In short, **s.ai is a practical AI SaaS starter package** for launching quickly with free-model-friendly workflows and scaling cleanly as your product grows.
